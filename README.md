A C++ project for entire semester for OOP course.
In this app I implement all I have learned in OOP lectures:Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism,Layer Architecture,Design Pattern.
An important feature for this project is Observer pattern.If I open more Cart windows and a CartReadOnly window ,the application will draw as many rectangles as we have added apartments.
