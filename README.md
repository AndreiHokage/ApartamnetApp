A C++ project for entire semester for OOP course.
In this app, I implement all I have learned in OOP lectures:Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism,Layer Architecture,Design Pattern.
An important feature for this project is Observer pattern.If I open more Cart windows and a CartReadOnly window ,the application will draw as many rectangles as we have added apartments.

In the app I implement the library 'vector' from STL C++.I tried to use 'Resource Acquisition Is Initialization',Move constructor,move assigment,copy constructor,iterator,template for classes and methods.

I uesd test driven development ,test coverage,data validation.
